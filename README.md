# Get All Live Urls (galu)
Galu uses the output of for example [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau), [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) or [waymore](https://github.com/xnl-h4ck3r/waymore) to determine which hosts are up, and only displays the url's of the live hosts.

# Usage:
Example:
```bash
waymore -i example.com -mode U | galu
```

# Installation:
Please download the galu bash file and **ensure it's located within a directory included in the system's PATH.**

Example:
```bash
go install github.com/yoerivegt/galu@latest
```

# Useful or suggestions?
Let me know through [github issues](https://github.com/CrunchV1/galu/issues) or discord (`0xcrunch`)!
